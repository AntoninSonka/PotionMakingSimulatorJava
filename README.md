Potion-making Simulator

The main goal of the game is to complete various requests. To fulfill a request, you need to buy ingredients, brew a potion, and then completing the request.

If you want to sell an ingredient or potion without completing a request, you can do so by selecting shelf, than select its name.

Every potion is made from three ingredients. To choose an ingredient, open the pot and select its name from the available options. Once you have chosen your ingredients, select the stir option. If everything is correct, you will have created a potion.

I have tried to make it as self-explanatory, so if there are some problems, please contact me for more info.
